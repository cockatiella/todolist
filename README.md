# todolist

## About

This is a simple todolist app that I made to learn the basics of React. It uses the [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) as a base.

## How to run

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the app
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## How to build

1. Run `npm run build` to build the app for production to the `build` folder.
2. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
3. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
4. Your app is ready to be deployed!
